Narrabot...


Perspective from The User Experience:
  User comes to greet screen (the CLI?)
    "Hi, what's your name?"
      Gets User name
    Uses TTS to greet the name with speech... introduces self as narrabot, would you like to see my
    collection of stories?

  User prompted y or n (will accept Y, N or YES, NO and other variations, error handling... HUH?)

  User will then have story collections appear
    for the purpose of this project will probably ONLY be Aesop's fables
    UPDATE (Hans Christian Andersen IS scrapable!!!!! http://www.gutenberg.org/files/27200/27200-h/27200-h.htm)
      But...
        I want to write the code for scraper, story_collections_contents and text_from_each_story
        to be reusable enough that I could do:
          Hans Christian Anderson
          Brother's Grimm
            or
          Other Fairy Tales and Folk Talkes in the future
        CONSDIER -- writing scraper as a module instead of a class and have each story_collections_contents
        perform the actual scrape?  Not sure.  Check with instructor

  After the story collection is selected (for this project only Aesop)
    the user will then be prompted:
      Would you like to see the entire table of contents?
        (will show <=10 stories at a time, and prompt user to see MORE or CANCEL)
        If User DOES NOT want to see entire table of contents secondary prompt?
          Would you like me to choose a story for you? (y / n) and it's randomized
        Last OPTION:
          Tell me about what's going on in your life and let me recommend a story for you.
            This basically does the same randomized story, except the selection will be limited to the most
            popular stories (this would probably have to be hard-coded in order to provide an acceptable
            "illusion" -- like the magic 8 ball toy)

  Once the story is selected:
    TTS (text to speech gem) will read the story out loud
    AND... while this is happening, will play an animated ascii image (loop through ascii text files)
    check flair RB for notes on how to do this


REGARDING ACTUAL CODE:

  cli.rb (all above as the user experience)

  scraper.rb -- NOTE: student scraper insufficient as model
    essentially, I want to write scraper.rb as a module which will be extended by story_collection_contents
    the reason being that although this is just aesop, if time permits I can add additional stories.

    for example Hans Christian Andersen
    http://www.gutenberg.org/files/27200/27200-h/27200-h.htm



  story_collection_contents.rb
  text_from_each_story.rb

  flair.rb ... this will have to be a folder for ascii images, but the flair.rb will run the loop as explained
  in Sammy Steiner's blog post... and also the other post I found on medium (notes in flair)
