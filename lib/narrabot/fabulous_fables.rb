    --- FABULOUS FABLES TELLS ALL ---

  HOLA, ALOHA, and KONICHIWA!!!  I'm Fabulous Fables.
  I work for Narrabot and Lazy Librarian.
    You'd think:
    if Lazy Librarian was gonna go through all the trouble of making
      Lazy Librarian Objects, then...
    she'd at least go through the trouble of grabbing the text for each story.
      Right?
    But alas.
    That's too much for her.
    She blames ME for spending too much time with Nokogiri.
    But, if she wants to blame anyone:
      she oughta look in the mirror first.
    That and... not to brag, but I'm kind of a big deal.
    No one splits text like me.
