# Narrabot

You're going to need the TTS gem in order to make this program work.

Basically, this gem scrapes Aesop's Fables (morals included!) and delivers the contents
in text or speech.  You can often switch from one to other.

And it even tells you your fortune! (not really, but it will dispense the moral of the story in Fortune Cookie Wisdom fashion).  If the moral is interesting, Narrabot can either read your story out loud to you, or print the text.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'narrabot'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install narrabot

## Usage

run this file within narrabot as bin/wake_the_narrabot
you may need to use CHMOD to change the settings.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
